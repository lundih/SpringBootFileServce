### File service
Upload and download any types of files from your browser.<br><br>
The options available are:<br>
<ul>
<li>Single file upload</li>
<li>Single file download</li>
<li>Mulitple file upload</li>
<li>Mulitple file (zip) download</li>
</ul><br>
The project is in Spring Boot. PostgreSQL is used to save file details after an upload for easier retrieval. Beware, the UI is extremely basic.<br><br>

<b>If it doesn't work as a file service... at least it'll still be a foiled service.</b>
